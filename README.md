# Titanic Survival Prediction using Decision Tree

This project contains a machine learning pipeline built to predict survival on the Titanic dataset. The pipeline handles preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification using a Decision Tree algorithm.

## üß† Features

- Missing value imputation using `SimpleImputer`
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- Feature scaling with `MinMaxScaler`
- Feature selection using `SelectKBest` with Chi-squared test
- Classification using `DecisionTreeClassifier`

## üìÅ Dataset

The notebook uses the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`) commonly used for binary classification tasks. Ensure this file is present in the same directory when running the notebook.
